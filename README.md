 📊 Dataset Overview

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Sessions | 156,455 |
| Total Revenue | ₹8.14 Crore |
| Avg Session Cost | ₹520.35 |
| Avg Energy Consumed | 32.50 kWh |
| Avg Session Duration | ~70 minutes |
| Total Energy Delivered | 5,084,268 kWh |
| Cities Covered | 5 (Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad) |
| Charging Stations | 200 |
| Vehicle Types | 4 (2-Wheeler, 3-Wheeler, 4-Wheeler, Commercial EV) |
| Weather Conditions | 3 (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy) |
| Time Period | 12 Months |



🧠 Advanced Analytics Performed

 🔹 Feature Engineering
- Extracted Charging Hour from timestamps → identified peak demand at 12PM (6,666 sessions)
- Created Month & Season features → revealed 8.8% revenue gap between best (January ₹69.8L) and worst month (February ₹64.1L)
- Built Revenue Per kWh aggregations → confirmed energy consumption as primary revenue driver
- Developed Duration Categories → Short (40,143) | Medium (70,153) | Long (46,159)

 🔹 Correlation Analysis
- Strong Positive: Energy Consumed ↔ Charging Cost — primary revenue driver confirmed
- Positive: Charging Duration ↔ Energy Consumption
- Fast vs Slow Charger: ₹522.65 vs ₹518.05 avg cost — only ₹4.60 gap despite same ~70 min duration

 🔍 SQL Business Intelligence Queries
